### Abstract
The goal of this project is to determine a way to spacially calibrate a lidar-camera pair using the surrounding environment. The methods developed can be implemented using real-world scenes using hardware that is predominantly preexisting in current vehicles. The methods described in this paper do not require any additional information about the surrounding environment and surfaces, are robust under different illuminations and fast enough to be implementedon-the-fly.The methods described utilise the intensities of the lidar and camera data without the need for feature extraction while still resulting in accurate estimations of the spatial calibration parameters
