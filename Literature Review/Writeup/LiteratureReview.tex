How do we get each form of error
Spacial --> straight forward
Temporal --> filters, length of communication, different clocks in sensors.


Attempts to fix temporal error
- clock synchronisation
- sensor reading time stamping 
etc. 


From the literature that has been reviewed, there are two main categories of calibration methods. The first uses markers that are of known shape, texture and size by design which are placed into the environment and used for calibration. This is a more hands-on, involved approach but it is often simpler. 
The other method is markerless calibration. In these cases, the goal is to use the information in the natural environment around the vehicle in order to calibrate the sensors. This often involves removing targets which are moving relative to the global frame and trying to isolate those which are static. 

The most common sensors used in autonomous vehicles are lidar and stereo cameras.
